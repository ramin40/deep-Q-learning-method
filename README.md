# deep-Q-learning-method
* in this repository i have implemented deep Q learning method for solving breakout atari game.
* this methode needs about 10 milion frames of environment for solving problem.
* you can read about deep Q learning here(https://deepmind.com/research/publications/human-level-control-through-deep-reinforcement-learning)
* i have taken the main idea from keras documentation so all credits must go to them.
